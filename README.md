# TV Shows Database

A simple TV show database!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

TV show data is served from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Installation

* Clone the repo in your terminal by clicking the green clone or download button at the top right and copy the URL

* In your terminal, type ```git clone URL```

* Replace ```URL``` with the url you copied
hit enter. This will copy all the files from this repo down to your computer.

* In your terminal, cd into the directory you just created

 ```cd your directory```

* Type ```npm install``` to install all dependencies

## Important: Before you start the app

This app needs an API key to request data from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

To do this:

* Add a .env file in the root folder of the project (the-tv-database/.env) 
* Copy-paste the credentials (to be provided by the developer)

You may now start the app by typing ```npm start``` in your terminal.
